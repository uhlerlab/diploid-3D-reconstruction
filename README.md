# Identifying 3D Genome Organization in Diploid Organisms via Euclidean Distance Geometry

This repository contains the accompanying code for the paper "Identifying 3D Genome Organization in Diploid Organisms via Euclidean Distance Geometry".

# Instructions for use
To obtain the 3D diploid configuration given data and hyperparameters (e.g. &rho; = 0.000001) run the following code (toy data set provided in directory "data/"):
```bash
matlab -nodesktop -nosplash -nodisplay -r "reconstruct_diploid_3D("data/",0.000001);exit"
```

 
# System requirements
MATLAB (R2017b), CVX, MOSEK
